- Real-time API
- Node.Js
- Firebase
- Cloud (Storage & Manage of Data)

# Background of the Project
In emergency or casualty circumstances, patients are frequently directed to a reputable multispeciality hospital or a well-known hospital due to the rapid improvements in medical technology. However, patients are frequently sent to other hospitals without being properly informed of the doctor's availability or the availability of appropriate treatment facilities in cases where the hospital is unable to provide the appropriate treatment, either due to the unavailability of a doctor or a lack of expertise in a specific diagnosis.

# Problem Statement
The system for emergency patients is inefficient and often leads to delays in the provision of appropriate treatment. Patients are often referred to hospitals without proper information about the availability of doctors or the availability of specialized facilities for their specific diagnosis. This results in a waste of time, resources, and an increased risk to the patient's health.

# Objective of the Project
To develop a diagnosis and referral system for emergency patients that will that will help patients and doctors to coordinate with multiple hospitals and make the treatment-transfer process fast & easy by storing & managing the data. This will reduce the time it takes to provide appropriate treatment and improve patient outcomes.

# Current Updates

- Registration and Authentication is working
- Required API to fetch data from the database
- Server module under construction
- Project is still under progress.
  
# Future works (Under Progress)

- New Realtime API Call needed
- Database of Doctors and the practice needed
- Data storage and Management is required on time-to-time basis.

# Expected Outcome
It will improve the efficiency of emergency healthcare delivery by reducing the time it takes to provide appropriate treatment. It will also reduce the risk of misdiagnosis and improper treatment by ensuring that patients are referred to hospitals with the necessary expertise and facilities. The system will also reduce the burden on hospital staff by automating the referral process, allowing them to focus on providing quality care to patients. It will play a major role in data management prior to history of patients as a part of medical history.
